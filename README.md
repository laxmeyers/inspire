# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
Here I was trying to learn how to create applications on the internet. This seems like a major part of software engineering and I wanted to use the main languages used by basically everyone to create something interesting and nice.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}
I created a software to give you inspirational quoates and images to give you an uplifting moment. This was suppose to be an application where you can plan and relax and not freak out about everything.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
This was to help me see the nice quotes. I like to see those uplifting quotes and this helps me and anyone else that wants to see them the ability to see them.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code with the bootstrap and axios libraries.

I am using html css and javascript. These three have to work together to put something on the screen. The html is what goes on the page, the css is how whats on the page is oriented and looks, and javascript is how the user or the internet can interact with it. I used an api for the pictures in the background and I used another api for the inspirational quote. This gets you a random picture and quote each time you visit the page.
