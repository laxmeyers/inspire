# Development Environment

I used visual studio code

I am using html css and javascript. These three have to work together to put something on the screen. The html is what goes on the page, the css is how whats on the page is oriented and looks, and javascript is how the user or the internet can interact with it. I used an api for the pictures in the background and I used another api for the inspirational quote. This gets you a random picture and quote each time you visit the page.
